# Command line for the win

This repository contains proof of completion of the first 27 tasks in the [CMD CHALLENGE](https://cmdchallenge.com/).
The CMD Challenge is a pretty cool game to test you on Bash skills.
Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated.

Plus, cool interface :)

This project is NOT mandatory at all. It is 100% optional.
